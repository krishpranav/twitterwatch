  <<-USAGE
  The #{'query'.bold} command can be used to execute raw SQL queries against the
  underlying database for Twitterwatch. The query results will be shown in a formatted
  table.
  
  #{'IMPORTANT:'.bold} The query command does not automatically isolate the data
  to the current workspace so queries will need to handle that on their own.
  Most tables will have a column called #{'workspace_id'.bold} which will contain
  the numeric ID of the workspace the object belongs to.
  
  For a more machine-parsable query result, please see the #{'query_csv'.bold} command.
  
  #{'USAGE EXAMPLES:'.bold}
  
  #{'See current workspaces:'.bold}
    query SELECT * from workspaces ORDER BY name
  
  #{'See geo coordinates for all statuses in a workspace:'.bold}
    query SELECT longitude,latitude FROM statuses WHERE geo IS TRUE AND workspace_id = 1
  
  #{'See statuses containing the word "password":'.bold}
    query SELECT u.screen_name, s.text, s.posted_at FROM users AS u JOIN statuses AS s ON s.user_id = u.id WHERE s.text LIKE '%password%'
  
  #{'See status geographic places by frequency:'.bold}
    query SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, place_name FROM statuses WHERE place_name IS NOT NULL GROUP BY place_name ORDER BY count DESC
